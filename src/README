Purpose:
Creates a hashtable, parses input file and hashes contents
using a multiplicative hashing function.
Resolves conflicts using hashing by chaining, implemented
using singly-linked lists.
Hashtable is dynamically growing (doubles when 3/4 full).

Notes:
1. Our jarfile must be run using the command
	java -jar BestStuffEver

2.Our main() function is located in the BestStuffEver class,
not the TestDrivers class.

3. Since we chose to only hash the userID String rather than
both the numeric customer ID and the userID String (we
asked the professor about this and he said it was fine),
we are not implementing the findCustomer() method of the
UIMS class.
